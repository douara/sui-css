<Docs.Section>
	<p>Column classes organize the columns out of the amount you need per row based on the twelve-column grid size; this means, if you need to display three equal-width columns, you must divide the size of the grid by the number of columns, which in this case is twelve. The result you get is the column size.</p>
	<p>By default, the columns align equally in size to occupy the entire row width in case alignment is inline, but if that is not the case, then the columns will properly align one below each other in stacked mode.</p>
	<p>Enable column styles; for that, use the class name as in the sample code below:</p>
	<Source dark language="html" code={codeCol} />
	<p>Remember, columns must go inside a row to work correctly.</p>

<Docs.Section title="Modifiers">
	<p>When columns are inline aligned, you can use the modifier class to specify the column size in a twelve-grid row instead of leaving it for auto-sizing. These modifiers won't affect when the row aligns columns in stacked mode.</p>
	<p>Enable column sizing; for that, use the class name as in the sample code below, being <code>$size</code> a number between 1 to 12:</p>
	<Source dark language="html" code={codesize} />
	<p>Remember, the sum of the column's size must not exceed 12, which is the limit of columns allowed by the row.</p>
