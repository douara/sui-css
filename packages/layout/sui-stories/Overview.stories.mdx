		<Docs.Section title="Containers">
			<p>
				Containers are the most basic layout in Shared UI Design System
				and are <strong>required when using grid system</strong>. Choose
				between full-width (meaning it's 100% wide all the time) and
				contained (meaning, it has a maximum width) content.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can nest containers, if that's what you need, but it won't
				always be required for WPMU DEV products.

		<Docs.Section title="Responsive Breakpoints">
			<p>Shared UI is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of media queries to create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.</p>
			<p>Shared UI primarily uses the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.</p>
			<p>Since we write our source CSS in Sass, all our media queries are available via Sass mixins:</p>
